## 📌 **Project Overview**

Botium Toys is a growing U.S.-based toy company expanding its online presence worldwide. As part of its growth, the IT Manager requested an **internal cybersecurity audit** to assess risks, evaluate existing security controls, and ensure compliance with key regulatory frameworks including **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and **SOC**.

This repository contains a complete audit package, including the scope, goals, risk assessment, control categories, and a fully completed controls and compliance checklist.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Assess Botium Toys’ current security posture
* Identify vulnerabilities, risks, and missing controls
* Evaluate compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards
* Provide data-driven recommendations to strengthen security
* Demonstrate end-to-end cybersecurity audit methodology

## 🧩 **Audit Methodology**

The audit was conducted based on:

### **🔹 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**

* Identify
* Protect
* Detect
* Respond
* Recover

### **🔹 Risk Assessment**

* Asset identification
* Threat & vulnerability analysis
* Risk scoring (1–10 scale)

### **🔹 Controls Assessment**

Controls evaluated across:

* Administrative / Managerial
* Technical
* Physical / Operational

### **🔹 Compliance Review**

Aligned with:

* **PCI DSS** (credit card security)
* **GDPR** (EU data privacy)
* **SOC 1 / SOC 2** (security, availability, confidentiality)

---

## 📊 **Key Findings Summary**

* Risk score of **8/10 (High)** due to lack of critical controls
* No encryption used for financial or customer data
* All employees had access to sensitive internal databases
* No intrusion detection system (IDS) implemented
* No backups or disaster recovery plan
* Weak password policy + no centralized password manager
* Legacy systems lacked documented maintenance procedures
* PCI DSS and SOC requirements **not met**
* GDPR only **partially compliant**

---

## 🛠️ **Recommendations**

### **High Priority**

* Implement encryption for cardholder and customer data
* Enforce least privilege & separation of duties
* Deploy IDS for threat monitoring
* Establish disaster recovery and data backup procedures
* Set up a centralized password management system
* Strengthen password policy to modern standards
* Classify all IT assets and maintain inventory

### **Medium / Low Priority**

* Create schedule for legacy system maintenance
* Improve access control documentation
* Continue monitoring physical security and CCTV systems
